To learn more about Pushover and the Pushover API, please visit the Pushover Website, `<https://pushover.net>`_.

::

   >>> from pushover_complete import PushoverAPI
   >>> p = PushoverAPI('azGDORePK8gMaC0QOYAMyEEuzJnyUi')  # an instance of the PushoverAPI representing your application
   >>> p.send_message('uQiRzpo4DXghDmr9QzzfQu27cmVRsG', 'Your toast is finished.')  # send a message to a user

That's all you need to get started with sending Pushover notifications from your Python program.
The majority of Pushover's API endpoints are accessible via :mod:`pushover_complete`.
Check out the :ref:`api` to see how.

The source code for this project is `hosted on Github <https://github.com/scolby33/pushover_complete>`_.

:mod:`pushover_complete` officially supports Python 2.7 and 3.5.
Currently, Python 3.3 and 3.4 pass all tests and function properly as well, but this could change: these versions are not officially targeted by development.
Support for Python 2.x may be dropped in the future, but only in a major version update (e.g. 1.x.y â†’ 2.x.y) and this change will be announced well in advance.

See :ref:`installation` for further information about installing :mod:`pushover_complete` in all manner of ways.

Roadmap

    roadmap

:mod:`pushover_complete` emerged from my frustrating experience with a number of only partially-complete Pushover packages.
It is my goal to fully support all of Pushover's API endpoints in this package, beginning with the most essential ones and working from there.
The current status of progress towards this goal is tracked in the :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>`.
