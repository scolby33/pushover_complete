Contributing
============

There are many ways to contribute to an open-source project, but the two most common are reporting bugs and issues and
contributing code.

If you have a bug or issue to report, please visit the
`issues page on Github <https://github.com/scolby33/pushover_complete/issues>`_ and open an issue there.

If you want to make a code contribution, check out the
`contributing page <http://pushover-complete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ in the docs for more
information.
