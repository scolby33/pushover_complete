To learn more about Pushover and the Pushover API, please visit the Pushover Website, `<https://pushover.net>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from pushover_complete import PushoverAPI
   >>> p = PushoverAPI('azGDORePK8gMaC0QOYAMyEEuzJnyUi')  # an instance of the PushoverAPI representing your application
   >>> p.send_message('uQiRzpo4DXghDmr9QzzfQu27cmVRsG', 'Your toast is finished.')  # send a message to a user

That's all you need to get started with sending Pushover notifications from your Python program.
The majority of Pushover's API endpoints are accessible via :code:`pushover_complete`.
Check out the `docs <http://pushover-complete.readthedocs.io/>`_ to learn more.

Installation
------------

Installation should be as easy as executing this command in your chosen terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install pushover_complete

:code:`pushover_complete` officially supports Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6.
Currently, Python 3.3 and 3.4 pass all tests and function properly as well, but this could change: these versions are not officially targeted by development.
Additionally, due to changes in Sphinx, the documentation cannot be built with Python 3.3.

As of version 1.1.0, support for Python 3.5 is deprecated. It will be removed in the next major version release.
This doesn't mean that Python 3.5 will stop working immediately, but I will no longer consider failing tests for that version to be critical.

Support for Python 2.x may be dropped in the future, but only in a major version update (e.g. 1.x.y â†’ 2.x.y) and this change will be announced well in advance.

Changelog
---------

Changes as of 6 April 2018

1.1.1 <6 April 2018>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- HOTFIX for 1.1.0
- Fix Python versions badge in the documents index
- Add the Python 3.6 classifier in :code:`setup.py` so the right versions are shown on PyPI

1.1.0 <6 April 2018>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Officially add support for Python 3.6
- Change default tox environment for Python 3 to py36
- Refactored :code:`.travis.yml` to be more concise and use the new :code:`py` `environment specification <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/example/basic.html#a-simple-tox-ini-default-environments>`_ (Pull `#8 <https://github.com/scolby33/pushover_complete/pull/8>`_)
